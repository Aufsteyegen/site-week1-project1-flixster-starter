### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes. I repeatedly referenced Lab 3 to guide myself through creating
asynchronous functions, API calls (e.g., generating API URLs), integrating
JavaScript with HTML (i.e., via the "querySelector" method), and adding event
listeners to HTML elements. I felt prepared for implementing all features. 

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have incorporated more accessibility features. I also would have
implemented smooth CSS transitions for dynamically-loaded HTML elements. 

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I should have spent more time on the presentation; I would have been more persuasive
had I included bullet points (rather than merely screenshots) to remind myself
to mention/elaborate on various features. As Elena mentioned, I also should have framed flaws I noticed differently by saying "Had I had more time, I would have done X" rather than
"This doesn't work at the moment," etc.
